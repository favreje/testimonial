## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Note: this design is limited for the time being to mobile and desktop devices

## My process

This exercise was helpful in reinforcing mobile-first design. I began with getting the
layout right with generic text, then tweaked the proportions of each container as I
went along, adding text styling, images, etc.

### Built with

- Raw CSS 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

First time using flexbox, so bit of a learning curve regarding general layout. Also my
first experince using svg, so some introduction to that and also using z-index to layer
the background graphic, between the container and the text.
